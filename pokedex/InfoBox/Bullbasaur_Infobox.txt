'''Bulbasaur''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''フシギダネ''' ''Fushigidane'') is a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Ivysaur}} starting at [[level]] 16, which evolves into {{p|Venusaur}} starting at level 32.

Along with {{p|Charmander}} and {{p|Squirtle}}, Bulbasaur is one of the three [[Kanto first partner Pokémon|first partner Pokémon of Kanto]] available at the beginning of [[Pokémon Red and Green Versions|Pokémon Red, Green]], [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Blue]], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|FireRed, and LeafGreen]].

==Biology==
[[File:Art Life 20230116 Bulbasaur.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Bulbasaur using its vines to climb a tree]]
Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal {{wp|amphibian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. Small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb that conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also provides it with energy through photosynthesis and from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.

First partner Pokémon are raised by {{tc|Pokémon Breeder|Breeder}}s to be distributed to new {{pkmn|Trainer}}s.<ref>''[[AG025|A Mudkip Mission]]''</ref> Having been raised by humans from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokémon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment.<ref>''[[EP102|The Mystery Menace]]''</ref> Bulbasaur have demonstrated a nurturing instinct towards younger, weaker Pokémon, one individual even using its vines to pick up a crying Pokémon, gently rocking it back and forth through the air while singing a "Bulba-by".<ref>''[[PK01|Pikachu's Vacation]]''</ref> Its vines are long and strong enough to allow Bulbasaur to grab the branches of trees and pull itself up to reach berries.<ref>[[Bulbasaur (SWSH Promo 303)]]</ref> Bulbasaur can survive for days without eating. As mentioned in [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], Bulbasaur is known to sleep in sunny spots.

It is found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}} and forests throughout the [[Kanto]] [[region]]. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as first partner Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been recently seen living in the [[Terarium]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]. A Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation.<ref>''[[EP051|Bulbasaur's Mysterious Garden]]''</ref> Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.

===Main series===
[[File:Ash Bulbasaur.png|thumb|250px|Bulbasaur in {{aniseries|JN}}]]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Ash's Bulbasaur]]=====
{{Ash}}'s Bulbasaur debuted in ''[[EP010|Bulbasaur and the Hidden Village]]'' as one of the Pokémon in the [[Hidden Village]], thus also marking the species' physical debut. Though initially wary of Ash, the two eventually warmed up to one another, and Bulbasaur challenged him to a {{pkmn|battle}}. Using {{AP|Pikachu}}, Ash won the battle, and Bulbasaur was {{pkmn2|caught}}. Unlike {{AP|Charmander}} and {{AP|Squirtle}}, which were caught in the two episodes following that of Bulbasaur, Bulbasaur remained in Ash's [[party]] for most of his {{pkmn|journey}} through [[Johto]] until ''[[EP225|Bulbasaur... the Ambassador!]]'', when Ash sent him to {{an|Professor Oak}}'s [[Professor Oak's Laboratory|lab]] to work as an ambassador between otherwise argumentative groups of Pokémon.

=====[[May's Bulbasaur]]=====
Much later on, while Ash was traveling in the [[Hoenn]] [[region]], {{an|May}} caught her own Bulbasaur after being separated from the group in ''[[AG073|Grass Hysteria!]]''. She remained with her throughout the rest of her journey in Hoenn, helping her to win the {{ci|Purika}} {{pkmn|Contest}} and place Top 8 in the [[Hoenn Grand Festival|regional]] [[Grand Festival]]. When she traveled to [[Kanto]] to continue her journey with Ash in ''[[AG133|The Right Place and the Right Mime]]'', May, too, left her Bulbasaur at [[Professor Oak's Laboratory]] to learn from Ash's while she, Ash, [[Max]], and {{an|Brock}} traveled throughout the Kanto region. May retrieved her during her travels in [[Johto]], where she evolved all the way into a {{p|Venusaur}}.

=====[[Shauna's Bulbasaur]]=====
{{an|Shauna}}'s first partner Pokémon is a Bulbasaur she received from {{an|Professor Sycamore}}. It first appeared in ''[[XY039|Summer of Discovery!]]'', and it was revealed to have evolved into Ivysaur by ''[[XY090|Tag Team Battle Inspiration!]]''

=====Other=====
In ''[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]'', a Bulbasaur was cloned from Ash's own Bulbasaur. The cloned Bulbasaur participated in the battle between the original Pokémon and the cloned Pokémon. Bulbasaur reappeared in ''[[Mewtwo Returns]]''.

In ''[[EP102|The Mystery Menace]]'', a Bulbasaur was abandoned by the [[Mayor of Trovitopolis]] during his childhood when it wouldn't evolve into Ivysaur. Since then, it grew to a very large size in the sewers. Aided by {{an|Misty}} and {{Tracey}}, Ash found the abandoned Bulbasaur while searching for his own, which had been taken by the giant Bulbasaur. After defeating the arrogant mayor and his personal SWAT team, Ash and his friends left the Bulbasaur with [[Nurse Joy]].

In ''[[HS14|Journey to the Starting Line!]]'', {{OBP|Gilbert|HS14}} was supposed to start his journey as a [[Pokémon Trainer]] with one of the three Kanto [[first partner Pokémon]], but they were scared off by [[Ash's Tauros]], forcing Gilbert to set out to find them with {{an|Professor Oak}}, {{Tracey}}, and {{Delia}}. Bulbasaur was the last one to be found, having been stuck in a tree that was surrounded by a group of {{p|Primeape}}. In the end, Bulbasaur was chosen by Gilbert as his first partner Pokémon.

In ''[[AG071|A Six Pack Attack!]]'', a Bulbasaur went with Professor Oak on his trip to [[Hoenn]] along with a {{p|Charmander}} and {{p|Squirtle}}.

In ''[[JN003|Ivysaur's Mysterious Tower!]]'', multiple Bulbasaur and Ivysaur traveled to a {{OBP|Gym|GO}} that was under construction in [[Vermilion City]]. Ash and [[Goh]], who were investigating the outbreak, followed them to the Gym and realized the horde had gone there so the Bulbasaur could absorb the sunlight necessary to evolve into new Ivysaur. They reappeared in a flashback in ''[[JN046|Getting More Than You Battled For!]]''.

Bulbasaur appears as a random trophy.

====Melee trophy information====
''"Bulbasaur is a cute Pokémon born with a large seed firmly affixed to its back; the seed grows in size as the Pokémon does. Along with Squirtle and Charmander, Bulbasaur is one of the three Pokémon available at the beginning of Pokémon Red and Blue. It evolves into Ivysaur."''

====Brawl trophy information====
''"A Seed Pokémon. From birth, Bulbasaur carries a large plant seed on its back. It uses the nutrients from the seed to grow bigger and bigger. Extended exposure to the sun will cause its body and seed to grow in size. Some say that once, when the seed was much lighter, Bulbasaur was able to get around on two legs. Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur."''

==Trivia==
* In the Japanese {{game2|Red|Green|Blue}}, the international {{game|Red and Blue|s}}, and the Japanese {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, [[Professor Oak]] classifies Bulbasaur as the "plant Pokémon" (Japanese: しょくぶつポケモン) when the player is about to choose it as their [[first partner Pokémon]], using the term while referring to its {{t|Grass|type}}. In the English versions of {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, he calls it the "grass Pokémon".
** This also occurs in the [[PO01|first episode]] of [[Pokémon Origins]].
* Bulbasaur's evolutionary line is the only first partner Pokémon family to have the {{type|Poison}}.
** Bulbasaur's evolutionary line is also the only first partner line to have each member appear at least once in the [[Super Smash Bros. series]].
* Bulbasaur shares its {{pkmn|category}} with its evolved forms and {{p|Sunkern}}. They are all known as the Seed Pokémon.
* Bulbasaur's number in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Fiore Browser number|Fiore Browser]] are the same: 001.
* Due to [[List of censored words in Generation V|the censor]] that prevents Pokémon with offensive [[nickname]]s being traded on the [[Global Trade System|GTS]], a Bulbasaur with an English name couldn't be traded on the GTS without a nickname in {{game|Black and White|s}}.
* In {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, Bulbasaur is programmed to be able to learn {{m|Charm}} through {{pkmn|breeding}}, but no other Pokémon in the {{egg|Grass}} or {{egg2|Monster}}s can legitimately learn it to pass down as an [[Egg Move]] in those games. In [[Generation III]] and {{gen|IV}}, Bulbasaur can inherit the move from {{p|Shroomish}} by chain breeding. In [[Generation V]] onwards, Bulbasaur can inherit the move directly from {{p|Cottonee}}.
* In {{g|Sun and Moon}}, Bulbasaur could learn Vine Whip at level 7 instead of Leech Seed. This oversight was later fixed in {{g|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon}}.
* According to the [[Trainer Race]] quiz minigame from [[PokéROM]], the word "strong" is a good adjective to describe Bulbasaur.

===Cultural impact===
[[File:Niue Dollar Pokémon.png|thumb|250px|right|$1 coins from {{wp|Niue}}]]
* {{wp|Niue}} released a one-dollar coin featuring Bulbasaur as part of a commemorative promotion for the Pokémon franchise, with Bulbasaur on one side and the nation's coat of arms on the other.
* While Bulbasaur is not considered to be part of the [[List of references to Pokémon in science|inspiration for the naming]] of ''{{wp|Bulbasaurus}}'', a genus of {{wp|dicynodont}}s, it has been noted that the similarities "may not be entirely coincidental".<ref>Sloat, Sarah. (February 1, 2017). "[https://www.inverse.com/article/27179-bulbasaurus-dicynodont-pokemon-dinosaur Scientists Who Discovered Bulbasaurus Didn’t Name It After a Pokémon]." ''Inverse''.</ref>

===Origin===
Bulbasaur is based on a {{wp|frog}}.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101230153442/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/sp/index4.html Interview with Jun'ichi Masuda and Ken Sugimori about ''Pokémon Black and White Versions'' (archived - Japanese text)]</ref><ref name=CreatorsOfPikachu>[https://web.archive.org/web/20211108083831/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/creator-profile-the-creators-of-pikachu/ Creator Profile: The Creators of Pikachu - Pokémon.com] (archived)</ref> In particular, its short legs, stout appearance, and ear-like protrusions on its head make it resemble {{wp|Ceratophrys|horned frogs}}. According to [[Ken Sugimori]] and [[Atsuko Nishida]], the latter designed Bulbasaur working backward from Venusaur, meaning Bulbasaur was the last of its evolutionary line to have been designed and was also directly based on Venusaur.<ref name=CreatorsOfPikachu /> The bulb on its back resembles a {{wp|Lilium|lily}} or {{wp|onion}}.

====Name origin====
Bulbasaur is a combination of ''{{wp|bulb}}''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19990221135156/http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/POKEMON/NEWS/NEWS.HTM GAME FREAK | POCKEMON JOURNAL] (archive)</ref><ref name=INSIDE>(February 27, 2016).

''4Gamer.net''</ref> (a rounded underground storage organ present in some plants) and ''{{wp|dinosaur}}''<ref name=4gamer/> or ''-saurus''<ref name=INSIDE/> (common suffix used in the names of extinct reptilian creatures, derived from the Ancient Greek word for {{wp|lizard}}). The name also sounds similar to the word ''bulbous''.

Fushigidane may be a combination of 不思議 ''fushigi'' (strange; mysterious) and 種 ''tane'' (seed), as well as a pun of the phrase 不思議だね ''Fushigi da ne?'' ("Isn't it strange?").
